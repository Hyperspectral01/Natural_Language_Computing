## 📂 **Repository Structure**  

The repository is organized into the following projects:  

1️⃣ **Text Preprocessing**  
   - Learn the basics of text preprocessing, including tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization.  
   - Prepare raw text data for further analysis and modeling.  

2️⃣ **Introduction to PyTorch**  
   - Get acquainted with PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework.  
   - Understand tensors, autograd, and building simple neural networks.  

3️⃣ **Word Embedding Models**  
   - Implement Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) and Skip-gram models.  
   - Understand how to represent words in vector space for various NLP tasks.  

4️⃣ **Sequence Modeling with GRU**  
   - Build models for sentiment analysis and machine translation using Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs).  
   - Explore sequence-to-sequence architectures and attention mechanisms.  

5️⃣ **Unsupervised Language Modeling**  
   - Develop language models to predict the next word in a sequence.  
   - Understand the fundamentals of unsupervised learning in NLP.
